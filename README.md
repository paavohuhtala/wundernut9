# wundernut9

My solution to [Wunderpähkinä vol. 9](https://github.com/wunderdogsw/wunderpahkina-vol9) implemented in Haskell.

The implemention is in [`src/Lib.hs`](src/Lib.hs), while the entry point is [`app/Main.hs`](app/Main.hs).

[Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) is recommended for building and running.

Run `stack build --test` to build the program and to run the test suite.

Run `stack exec wundernut9-exe` to run the program with the challenge input.
